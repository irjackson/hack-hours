// Atticus has been invited to a dinner party, and he decides to purchase a bottle of wine. 
// However, he has little knowledge of how to choose a good bottle. Being a very frugal 
// gentleman (yet disliking looking like a cheapskate), he decides to use a very simple rule. 
// In any selection of two or more wines, he will always buy the second-cheapest.

// Given an array of wine objects, write a function that returns the name of the wine he will buy for the party. 
// If given an empty array, return null. If given an array of only one, Atticus will buy that wine.

// Examples

// chosenWine([
//   { name: "Wine A", price: 8.99 },
//   { name: "Wine 32", price: 13.99 },
//   { name: "Wine 9", price: 10.99 }
// ]) ➞ "Wine 9"

// chosenWine([{ name: "Wine A", price: 8.99 }]) ➞ "Wine A"

// chosenWine([]) ➞ null

// Notes

// All wines will be different prices, so there is no confusion in the ordering.
